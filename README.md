# Graph-Based Friend Recommendation System

## Project Overview

A **Machine Learning-based Friend Recommendation System** that predicts potential friendships in a social network using **graph theory**.  

- Models users as **nodes** and friendships as **edges**  
- Uses graph-based features like **common neighbors, Jaccard similarity, Adamic-Adar index**  
- Predicts friendship probabilities with **logistic regression**  

---

## Features

- Graph-based network analysis and visualization using **NetworkX**  
- Scalable and modular design  
- Evaluation metrics: **precision, recall, F1-score, ROC curve, precision-recall curve**
