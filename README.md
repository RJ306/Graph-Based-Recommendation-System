# Graph-Based-Recommendation-System

## Project Overview
A **Machine Learning-based Friend Recommendation System** that predicts potential friendships in a social network using **graph theory**.  

- Models users as **nodes** and friendships as **edges**  
- Uses features like **common neighbors, Jaccard similarity, Adamic-Adar index**  
- Predicts friendship probabilities with **logistic regression**  

---

## Features
- Graph-based network analysis and visualization (**NetworkX**)  
- Scalable and modular design  
- Evaluation: precision, recall, F1-score, ROC & precision-recall curves
